#BACKEND SETUP
Install Python 3.10 or newer on your system and verify it by running python --version in the terminal.

Download or clone the backend project folder onto your computer.

Open a terminal inside the backend project directory.

Create a virtual environment using the command:
python -m venv venv

Activate the virtual environment:

Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

Mac/Linux: source venv/bin/activate

Install all required backend dependencies using:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Install MongoDB Community Server on your system from the official MongoDB website.

After installation, start the MongoDB service manually or ensure it is running automatically in your system services.

Open MongoDB Compass (optional) and create a database named:
RetailorAI

In the backend project folder, create a .env file containing:

MONGODB_URI

DB_NAME

Optional: API keys for enhancement/compliance engines if using external services

Ensure your .env file uses the correct MongoDB connection — example:
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017

After confirming MongoDB is running, start the FastAPI backend using:
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

Once the server starts, open your browser and visit:
http://localhost:8000/docs
to access the Swagger API interface for testing.

Test your file upload using the /upload-asset route. Each uploaded file will be stored in GridFS and also saved locally in the tmp/ folder.

Run enhancements like background removal, Smart Enhancement v2, Smart Crop, Multi-Channel Auto Resize, or Layout Suggestions using the generated file_id.

Each enhancement request automatically creates a new file ID, allowing unlimited chained enhancement versions.

Smart crop, smart enhancement v2, auto-resize, batch processing, template application, and campaign workspace storage all function using MongoDB + GridFS without requiring any additional services.

To use AI-based Layout Suggestions or Predictive Creative Performance Engine, ensure your system supports PyTorch. These models will download automatically on first use.

If performance models are large, the backend may take a few extra seconds to load the first enhancement or prediction. After that, they remain cached.

To stop the backend server, press CTRL + C in the terminal running Uvicorn.

You can safely delete any asset using the /asset/{file_id} DELETE route, which removes the file from GridFS and your processed folder.

The backend is now fully configured and ready for integration with your frontend or mobile app.

#FRONTEND SETUP

Every feature you implemented in FastAPI is accessible through a beautiful, professional UI. The application is production-ready with proper error handling, loading states, and user feedback throughout.

Import or download or clone the frontend folder from the given git repository
do "cd frontend" in the terminal and then "npm install" to install all dependencies

**Next Steps**:
1. Start your FastAPI backend: `uvicorn main:app --reload`
2. Start the Next.js frontend: `npm run dev`
3. Visit `http://localhost:3000`
4. Upload assets, create projects, and explore all features!

All buttons, forms, and interactions properly trigger your backend endpoints and handle responses correctly.
