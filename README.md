Problem Statement & Market Need :

The Challenge

Retail media advertising presents a critical bottleneck for brands, particularly small-to-medium advertisers:

Resource Intensity: Creating creatives for retail media campaigns requires specialized design skills, expensive agency partnerships, and significant time investment
Compliance Complexity: Each retailer enforces unique guidelines (layout, sizing, messaging, brand placement) that are difficult to interpret and implement consistently
Multi-Format Demands: Campaigns require numerous creative variants across channels—in-store displays, online banners, social media posts—each with distinct specifications
Agency Dependence: Smaller advertisers lack access to affordable creative support, creating barriers to entry in the lucrative retail media space
Iterative Inefficiency: Manual review cycles, guideline violations, and reformatting delays extend time-to-market and increase costs
Market Need

With retail media advertising projected to reach $140+ billion globally by 2028, there's urgent demand for:

Scalable creative production tools accessible to non-expert users
Automated compliance validation against complex, evolving guidelines
Cost-effective alternatives to traditional agency models
Rapid creative iteration and multi-channel adaptation capabilities
